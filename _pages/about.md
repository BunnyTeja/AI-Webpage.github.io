The Artificial Intelligence Institute of UofSC (AIISC) resulted in the university-wide excellence initiative. It started with Prof. Amit Sheth, moving as the founding director, with his initial team in 2019. It has rapidly grown to over 25 researchers, with the joining of Prof. Biplav Srivastava, Forest Agostinelli, and Qi Zhang in 2020. As a university-wide institute, it already has collaborations with a majority of the colleges on the campus.
